## Downloading the Closeread _extension directory

To start, please run the code in the  R chunk below once. This will download a
directory called `_extensions` that has the Closeread javascript code needed to
create Closeread webpages, and it will also download an image needed for these
exercises.

If downloading the Closeread extension does not work from running the code
below, please try running the following command in the terminal (bottom tab near
the console).

1. Make sure the terminal is in the same directory as this .qmd file.
2. Run the following command in the terminal: `quarto add qmd-lab/closeread`

This should create a `_extensions` directory that has the javascript code needed
to run the closeread document.

If this doesn't work you might have to start a new terminal by going to Tools at
the top of the RStudio menu, then click on terminal, then click on new terminal.


```{r message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

install_closeread <- function() {
  system("quarto add --no-prompt qmd-lab/closeread")
}

install_closeread()

## Closeread basics


Let's start with a basic Closeread section `{.cr-section}` where we scroll text
over an R graphic.

## Highlighting


Let's now explore highlighting text and code. 

As always, we start by wrapping everything in a `{.cr-section}`.

Let's first highlight some code, and then let's highlight some text. 




::::{.cr-section}







:::{#cr-dplyr}
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

library(dplyr)

  group_by(mtcars, am) |>
    summarize(avg_wt = mean(wt))

```

| {#cr-limerick}
| There once was a coder named [Claire]{#cr-claire},
| Whose scripts worked by luck and a [prayer]{#cr-prayer}.
|   When she coded in R,
|   Her results were bizarreâ€”
| But her plots were a work of great [flair]{#cr-flair}!

## Zooming


Let's now explore zooming in on a specific part an image.

As always, we start by wrapping everything in a `{.cr-section}`.
