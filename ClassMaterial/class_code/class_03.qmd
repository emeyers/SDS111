# Downloading data files 


We will continue to analyze the OkCupid data today. Please run the code below once to download the data. 


```{r download_files, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# you could also try downloading these files using the SDS111 package
library(SDS111)

download_data("profiles_revised.csv")


# If you don't have the SDS111 package working yet, you can download the files using the following commands
#download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emeyers/SDS111/main/ClassMaterial/data/profiles_revised.csv", "profiles_revised.csv", mode = "wb")

```

## Loading the OkCupid data


Learning about statistics and plots for categorical and quantitative data, we will continue to look at the [OkCupid data](https://www.okcupid.com)

The code below loads a data frame called `profiles` that contains information about people who have profiles on OkCupid.


```{r data_frames_1}

# library(SDS111)
# download_data("profiles_revised.csv")

profiles <- read.csv("profiles_revised.csv")

#View(profiles)        # the View() function only works in R Studio!


```




$\\$







## Part 1: Analyzing categorical data


Categorical variables take on one of a fixed number of possible values. 

For categorical variables, we usually want to view:

 * **Frequency table**: How many items are each category 
 * **Relative frequency table**: The proportion (or percentage) of items in each category

Let's examine categorical data by looking at drinking behavior on OkCupid


```{r categorical_1}

# Get information about drinking behavior



# Create a table showing how often people drink




```





$\\$




We can create a relative frequency table using the function: `prop.table(my_table)` 

Can you create a relative frequency table for the drinking behavior of the people in the okcupid data set in the R chunk below? 


```{r categorical_2}





```





$\\$




### Bar plots (no pun intended)

We can plot the number of items in each category using a bar plot: barplot(my_table) 

Can you create a bar plot for the drinking behavior of the people in the okcupid data set? 

```{r categorical_3}





```





$\\$





Is there a problem with using the bar plot function without any of the extra arguments? 

[XKCD illusterates the point](https://xkcd.com/833/)

Can you figure out how to fix your plot? 

We can also create pie charts using the pie function

```{r categorical_4}




```



Some pie charts [are more informative than others](http://robslink.com/SAS/democd91/pyramid_pie.htm)




$\\$





## Part 2: Analyzing a single quantitative variable


Let's examine the heights of OkCupid users. We can plot histograms of heights using the `hist()` function. 


```{r quantitative_1}






```




$\\$



We can use the `mean()` and `median()` functions to extract measures of the central tendency for OkCupid user's heights.



```{r quantitative_2}






```



What went wrong? 


We can ignore missing values using the `na.rm = TRUE` argument


```{r quantitative_3}







```




$\\$





We can add lines to our plots using the `abline(`) function. For example `abline(v = 60)` would add a vertical line at the value of 60. 

Can you create a histogram of OkCupid user's heights add a vertical line at the mean height of OkCupid users? 



```{r quantitative_4}







```

## Part 3: Quantitative data: measures of spread


Beyond measuring the central tendency of a quantitative variable, we also want to measure the spread of the data. One statistics to characterize the spread of data is the standard deviation.

Let's calculate the standard deviation of OkCupid user's heights using the `sd()` function. 



```{r quantitative_5}




```


We can also calculate the interquartile range (IQR) to characterize the spread of a quantitative variable. The IQR is the the 25th percentile (Q1) to the 75th percentile (Q3) of the data. It is a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of the data. The IQR is less sensitive to outliers than the standard deviation, and it is often used in boxplots to show the spread of the data.

Let's calculate the  can calculate Q1 and Q3 using the `quantile()` function and the IQR using the `IQR()` function.

```{r quantitative_6}


# Q1 and Q3






# IQR








```





Boxplots visually show a version of a 5 number summary (min, Q1, median, Q3, max). We can create boxplots using the `boxplot()` function. 

Let's create a boxplot of OkCupid user's heights.


```{r quantitative_7}





```

If there are extreme outliers in a plot we need to investigate them. If they are errors we can remove them, otherwise we need to take them into account. 






$\\$





## Part 4: Plots and statistics for two quantitative variables



Let's now look at data from CitiBike in New York City. How many cases are there any how many variables? What does each case corresond to? 

```{r quantitative_8}

# download.file("https://yale.box.com/shared/static/t3ezfphfg729x03079aajop0d3f454wm.rda", "daily_bike_totals.rda")

load("daily_bike_totals.rda")

```





$\\$





Scatter plots show the relationships between two quantitative variables. We can use the `plot(x, y)` function to create scatter plots. 

Create a scatter plot of the maximum temperature as a function of the minimum temperature. Based on this plot predict what you think the correlation is between the minimum and maximum temperature.

Once you have a prediction for the correlation, calculate the correlation between the minimum and maximum temperature using the `cor()` function.



```{r quantitative_9}


# scatter plot




# correlation 




```




We can also create line plots using the `plot(x, y)` function. If we set the `type` argument to "o" (for "overplotted") this will add both points and a line. 

Let's create a line of the number of trips as a function of the date using the `plot(x, y, type = "o")` function.


```{r quantitative_10}





```
